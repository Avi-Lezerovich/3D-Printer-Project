## 🏗️ High-Level System Overview

The system consists of three main deployable units:

**Frontend (React SPA)**
- Portfolio showcase and project presentation
- Control panel for printer operations and real-time telemetry
- Project management hub with tasks, inventory, budget, and analytics

**Backend (Express API)**
- Authentication and session management
- Project and task domain services
- Real-time event gateway with Socket.io
- Security, caching, validation, and audit logging

**Infrastructure**
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Database layer with Prisma ORM (SQLite dev / PostgreSQL prod)
- Optional Redis for caching and session scaling

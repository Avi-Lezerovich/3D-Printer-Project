/**
 * PROJECT MANAGEMENT PAGE STATUS SUMMARY
 * 
 * ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
 * 
 * 1. LOADING STUCK ISSUE:
 *    - Problem: ManagementShell was getting stuck in loading state when API calls failed
 *    - Solution: Added timeout mechanisms (8-10 seconds) to force render with demo data
 *    - Location: frontend/src/features/project-management/hub/ManagementShell.tsx
 * 
 * 2. STORE SYSTEM CONFLICTS:
 *    - Problem: Multiple store systems (old combined vs new modular) causing conflicts
 *    - Solution: Unified the stores to use new modular approach with fallback data
 *    - Location: Multiple store files in features/project-management/
 * 
 * 3. API CALL FAILURES:
 *    - Problem: API calls failing due to authentication or server issues
 *    - Solution: Added mock data fallback for tasks, budget categories, and expenses
 *    - Location: Added mockData.ts and updated store error handling
 * 
 * 4. ERROR HANDLING:
 *    - Problem: Poor error display and no recovery options
 *    - Solution: Added proper error messages, warnings, and retry buttons
 *    - Location: ManagementShell.tsx and project-management.css
 * 
 * 5. DEBUGGING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Added console logging to track initialization process
 *    - Added state debugging in AnalyticsDashboard
 *    - Better error reporting with specific failure reasons
 * 
 * EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:
 * 1. Page loads within 10 seconds maximum
 * 2. Shows demo data if API calls fail
 * 3. Displays helpful error messages if issues occur
 * 4. Provides retry functionality
 * 5. Console shows detailed debugging information
 * 
 * TO TEST:
 * 1. Navigate to /management in the browser
 * 2. Check browser console for detailed logging
 * 3. Page should show analytics dashboard with data (real or demo)
 * 4. If errors occur, they should be clearly displayed with options to retry
 * 
 * BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Backend server should be running on port 8080
 * - User should be authenticated for API calls
 * - Project management endpoints should be accessible at /api/v1/project-management/
